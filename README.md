# *VELVAX Sales Analysis Dashboard*

## *📌 Project Overview*
This repository contains an *Excel dashboard project* created for analyzing *sales and revenue trends* and extracting *key business insights* to support data-driven decision-making.

## *📊 Data Source & Processing*
I sourced the *raw data from the internet, and it already contained **some inconsistencies. To make the dataset **more inconsistent, randomized, and unique, I asked **ChatGPT* to modify the raw data, adding *more fluctuations, duplicates, and randomness* to make it more challenging for data cleaning and analysis.  

ChatGPT provided me with an updated *raw data file, which was **not cleaned—it was **just a more unique and difficult raw dataset* for better practice. I then:  
✔ *Cleaned the data* by handling inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values  
✔ *Processed the data* by creating additional columns for analysis  
✔ *Built pivot tables* to extract meaningful insights  
✔ *Designed an interactive dashboard* to visualize trends  

## *📉 Why the Raw Data in This Project is Different?*  
While filming my project showcase, I realized it would be beneficial to *showcase the raw file* alongside my cleaned version. However, when I tried to download the raw file from *ChatGPT again after 2-3 days, it was **no longer available* due to the time gap.  

Since I had already made modifications to the raw file when I first downloaded it, I didn’t have the original version saved separately on my laptop. As a result, I *manually introduced inconsistencies into the raw data again* to include it in this project.  

> However, in reality, the *original raw data provided by ChatGPT was even more inconsistent—it had **more fluctuations, more duplicates, and required extensive cleaning. The version in this repository has **fewer inconsistencies* than the one I initially worked on.

## *🛠️ Project Workflow*
